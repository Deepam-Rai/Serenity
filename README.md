# Theme  
Population Preventive Healthcare

# Technology Used:
- Front end - Svelte JS
- Back End  - Flask

The idea is to create a full stack web application that uses Svelte JS as front end. The choice is made because, Svelte JS is the JS compiler which aims at generating the vanilla js files that are optimised. Flask is chosen because of its un opinionated nature and compactness.
